## ADR-15: Monitoring & Logging Strategy

### Status
Adopted

### Context
Monitoring and logging are pivotal to ensure smooth operation of our system, quick debugging, and resolution of issues. An effective strategy here not only aids developers but also instills confidence in stakeholders about the system's robustness. The primary options we evaluated were:

1. **[ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack)**:
    - **Elasticsearch**: A search and analytics engine.
    - **Logstash**: Data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch.
    - **Kibana**: Visualizes data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

2. **[AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)**:
    - Monitors AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real-time.
    - Provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, understand and respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.

3. **[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)**:
    - Cloud-based monitoring and analytics solution that allows for full-stack observability, including logs, metrics, and traces from multiple platforms.

For our application, a combination of comprehensiveness, scalability, and cost-effectiveness was sought.

### Decision
We have chosen the **ELK Stack** for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Solution**: ELK provides a full-stack solution from ingesting logs (Logstash) to storing (Elasticsearch) and visualizing them (Kibana). This integrated solution ensures there are fewer integration points and potential points of failure.

2. **Scalability & Flexibility**: Elasticsearch, being a distributed system by nature, scales out seamlessly. This means as our user base grows or the data inflow increases, we can manage it by scaling our Elasticsearch cluster.

3. **Open Source**: The ELK Stack's core features are open source, providing cost-effectiveness and the flexibility to customize or tweak components as per our needs.

4. **Rich Ecosystem & Community**: Being one of the most popular logging solutions, the community and ecosystem around ELK are robust, ensuring updates, plugins, and solutions to common issues.

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- **Unified Interface**: Kibana provides a singular interface for monitoring, visualizations, and alerting.
- **Cost-effective**: Given that the core features are open source, initial costs are lower.
- **Customizable**: Being open-source, it can be tailored to our specific needs.

**Cons**:
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Compared to fully managed solutions like Datadog, ELK might need more hands-on maintenance.
- **Complexity**: As with any powerful tool, ELK comes with a learning curve and initial setup complexity.
