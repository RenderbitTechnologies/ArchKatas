## ADR-07: Database Selection Strategy

### Status
Adopted

### Context
The trip management dashboard requires an efficient, scalable, and reliable database system to store and manage user data, reservations, travel details, and analytics. The primary paradigms are:
- **[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)**: Relational databases like **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** and **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** which offer structured data storage using tables.
- **[NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)**: Non-relational databases like **[Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)** and **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** which are typically more scalable and offer flexible data models.
- **Mixed Strategy**: Using a combination of both SQL and NoSQL databases based on specific use cases and requirements.

### Decision
A **Mixed Strategy** is chosen for the trip management dashboard due to:
1. **Data Variety**: Different aspects of the application, such as user profiles, trip details, and analytical data, may have varied storage requirements.
2. **Scalability**: While NoSQL databases like Cassandra offer high write scalability, SQL databases might be preferred for complex queries and transactional data.
3. **Flexibility**: Leveraging the strengths of both database types allows for a more flexible data strategy.
4. **Optimized Cost**: Some data, like analytical data, might be more cost-effectively stored in NoSQL, while transactional data might benefit from the robustness of SQL.
5. **Performance**: Certain operations can be more performant on one type of database than the other.

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Can utilize the specific strengths of each database type.
- **Flexibility for Future**: As application needs evolve, having a mixed strategy provides flexibility.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Can ensure optimal performance for diverse application needs.

**Cons**:
- **Increased Complexity**: Managing multiple databases can introduce complexity.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensuring consistency between different databases can be challenging.
- **Operational Overhead**: More effort required for backup, maintenance, and monitoring of multiple databases.
