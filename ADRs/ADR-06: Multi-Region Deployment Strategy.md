## ADR-06: Multi-Region Deployment Strategy

### Status
Adopted

### Context
The trip management dashboard aims to serve users worldwide, with primary users in North America and Western Europe. It's crucial to determine whether deploying in a single cloud region would suffice or if a multi-region strategy is more appropriate. The two strategies are:
- **Single Region**: Deploying all services and infrastructure in one cloud region, possibly with multiple availability zones.
- **Multiple Regions**: Distributing deployment across several geographic regions to cater to a global audience.

### Decision
A **Multi-Region** deployment strategy is selected for the trip management dashboard due to:
1. **Latency Reduction**: Serving users from a region closer to them reduces latency and offers a faster user experience.
2. **High Availability**: In case of a regional failure, traffic can be rerouted to an operational region, ensuring minimal downtime.
3. **Data Resilience**: Storing data backups in multiple regions ensures data safety in case of disasters.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Some countries/regions have data residency requirements, necessitating data to remain within geographical boundaries.
5. **Load Distribution**: Distributing user load across regions can prevent overloading one region and ensure smooth operation.

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster load times for a global audience.
- **Higher Fault Tolerance**: Protection against regional outages.
- **Flexibility**: Ability to address specific regulatory or business needs per region.

**Cons**:
- **Increased Complexity**: Managing deployments across regions can be more complex.
- **Cost Implications**: Multi-region deployment may lead to increased costs due to data transfer charges and maintaining infrastructure in multiple regions.
- **Data Synchronization**: There's a need to ensure data consistency across regions, which might introduce synchronization challenges.
