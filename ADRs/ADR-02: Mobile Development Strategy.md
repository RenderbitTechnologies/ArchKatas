## ADR-02: Mobile Development Strategy

### Status
Adopted

### Context
Our application's aim is to reach a wide range of users across both iOS and Android platforms. The choice between native and cross-platform development is crucial to ensure we deliver an optimal user experience, achieve rapid time-to-market, and maintain a cost-effective development cycle.

**Native Development (iOS & Android)**:
- **Pros**:
    - **Performance**: Leveraging platform-specific hardware acceleration and APIs can lead to smoother animations and more responsive UI.
    - **Features**: Immediate access to the latest platform-specific features and updates.
    - **UX/UI**: Can deliver a genuine platform-specific experience conforming to platform guidelines.
- **Cons**:
    - **Development Speed**: Requires maintaining two separate codebases, effectively doubling the development and maintenance effort.
    - **Resource Intensive**: Requires separate teams or developers with expertise in each platform.

**Flutter**:
- **Pros**:
    - **Unified Codebase**: A single codebase for both platforms.
    - **Performance**: High-performance rendering engine.
    - **Customizable UI**: Can achieve any design without being bound by platform-specific components.
- **Cons**:
    - **Maturity**: Newer in the market compared to React Native, so there might be fewer third-party libraries or plugins.
    - **Language**: Uses Dart, which is less common in the developer community.

**React Native**:
- **Pros**:
    - **Unified Codebase**: Single codebase to target both major mobile platforms.
    - **Performance**: Near-native performance with the ability to integrate native modules if needed.
    - **Community**: Large community, a vast array of third-party libraries, and strong support due to its maturity.
    - **Language**: Uses JavaScript, one of the most popular and widely adopted languages.

### Decision
Given our intent to maintain a streamlined tech stack and reduce the number of languages/frameworks in our stack, **React Native** emerges as the preferred choice. Not only does it align with our frontend choice of React, but it also brings the benefits of a vast ecosystem, wide community support, and the flexibility of JavaScript.

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- **Unified Development**: A consistent development experience across web and mobile.
- **Cost-Effective**: Faster development cycle due to a shared codebase across platforms.
- **Community Support**: Benefitting from a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools.

**Cons**:
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Might need to create or use native modules for certain platform-specific features, although the community usually addresses these quickly.
