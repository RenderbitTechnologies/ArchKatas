## ADR-18: Testing Strategy

### Status
Adopted

### Context
Given the complexity and scale of our application, it's imperative to ensure the quality and reliability of our software across all platforms - backend, frontend, and mobile. We need robust testing strategies across unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Here are the considerations:

#### For Java/Spring Boot (Backend):
1. **Unit Testing**:
    - **[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)**: A popular and widely used testing framework for Java.
    - **[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)**: For creating mock objects.

2. **Integration Testing**:
    - **[Spring Boot Test](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/)**: For testing the integration of layers in a Spring Boot app.

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - **[RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/)**: For testing REST services in Java.

#### For JavaScript/React (Frontend):
1. **Unit Testing**:
    - **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: A JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook.
    - **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)**: For testing React components.

2. **Integration Testing**:
    - **[Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)**: JavaScript testing utility by Airbnb.

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)**: A fast, reliable, and capable testing tool.

#### For Dart/Flutter (Mobile App):
1. **Unit Testing**:
    - **[Flutter Test](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing)**: Provides a rich set of testing features built into Flutter.

2. **Integration Testing**:
    - **[Flutter Driver](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction)**: The Flutter equivalent of Selenium for mobile applications.

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - **[Appium](http://appium.io/)**: An open-source tool for automating mobile apps.

### Decision
Given the technologies and frameworks adopted for our application development:

- For **backend** tests, we're leveraging **JUnit** for unit tests, **Spring Boot Test** for integration tests, and **RestAssured** for end-to-end tests.
- For **frontend**, we're adopting **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit tests, **Enzyme** for integration tests, and **Cypress** for end-to-end tests.
- For **mobile**, we've chosen **Flutter Test** for unit tests, **Flutter Driver** for integration tests, and **Appium** for end-to-end tests.

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures better software reliability.
- **Quick Feedback Loop**: Efficient unit and integration tests offer quick feedback during development.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Testing**: Tools like Appium allow for testing across different mobile platforms.

**Cons**:
- **Overhead**: Multiple testing tools and libraries can introduce additional overhead in terms of maintenance.
- **Learning Curve**: Each tool or framework may come with its own learning curve for the development team.
