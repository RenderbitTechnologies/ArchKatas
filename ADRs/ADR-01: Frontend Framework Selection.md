## ADR-01: Frontend Framework Selection

### Status
Adopted

### Context
The new trip management dashboard platform requires a frontend framework that ensures efficient development, a rich user interface, high interactivity, and scalability with user growth. The main contenders are:
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library by Facebook that is component-based, has a vast ecosystem, a broad community, and impressive performance.
- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**: A comprehensive MVC framework by Google. It provides numerous tools, supports two-way data binding, but has a steeper learning curve.
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**: A progressive JavaScript framework with incremental adoptability, easy integration, and features from both React and Angular.

### Decision
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is chosen for the trip management dashboard's frontend development due to:
1. Component-Based Structure
2. Strong Community and Ecosystem
3. Performance with Virtual DOM
4. Flexibility
5. Maturity
6. Potential for mobile convergence with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

### Consequences
**Pros**:
- Efficient development with component reusability
- High performance for dynamic content
- Rich ecosystem with varied libraries and tools
- Abundant talent pool due to React's popularity

**Cons**:
- Choosing additional libraries for tasks like state management or routing
- Requires a detailed build setup (possibly involving [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/))
- React's learning curve
